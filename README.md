# MushROMs (2014)
An archive of what MushROMs looked like in 2014.

## About
At this time, I had decided to take MushROMs in a new direction. I decided it no longer had to be an editor just for Super Mario All-Stars, but it could be a generic Super Nintendo games editor. A lot of the functionality is portable, and it was a good idea to generalize a lot of what I had done to make a more powerful editor.

This version probably made it a lot farther than any other (hence why it went on for two years).

The project was discarded when poor designs of window forms could not be reverted. Knowing about GitHub back then would have been really nice.
